      <font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">DESCRIPTION:</b>A stand-alone Senior High School (SHS) is a secondary school that operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or Integrated School (IS). It has its own distinct location and a separate school head (principal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS, which is located within an existing JHS or IS and shares the same school.
